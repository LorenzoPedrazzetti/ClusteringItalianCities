Clustering Italian Cities
-
Exploring the Cultural Heritage of the Most Prominent Italian Cities.

The idea at the base of this project comes from the need to visualize the most interesting cultural attractions in the landscape of the Italian cities, leveraging the Foursquare API.

The segregation was done using the scikit-learn python library for the machine learning algorithm, a k-means clustering.
